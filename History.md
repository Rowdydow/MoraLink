### Technical Implementation
```
Workflow Process:
1. App Script scans Fab Schedule for unlinked jobs
2. Queries JobIndex for corresponding Moraware ID
3. Extracts last 5 digits of Moraware ID for URL construction
4. Combines base Moraware URL + shop identifier + job ID
5. Applies hyperlink to job number in Fab Schedule
6. Repeats for all qualifying jobs
```

### Business Impact
This system delivered **immediate operational improvements**:
- **Time Savings**: Eliminated 15-25 seconds per job lookup
- **Click Reduction**: Removed hundreds of daily navigation clicks
- **Error Prevention**: Eliminated manual URL construction errors
- **Workflow Efficiency**: Streamlined job access for all team members
